# PyFileFinder

In this program, you are required to enter the file name whose absolute path you want to find out.

You can additionally add the starting path from where the search should begin.  If you don't specify a starting point, the search will begin from root directory.  


This program will also list out multiple occurrences of the file (if they exist).
